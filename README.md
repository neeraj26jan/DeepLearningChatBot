# DeepLearningChatBot
This is an Deep Learning Based AI-powered chatbot using Python programming. This chatbot will not only answer your questions accurately but will also save chat logs, allowing it to retrain and update itself with new datasets the next time you train the model.

## Dependencies
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* tensorflow

We can install these all by giving command <br />
` pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow `

## Training Dataset
Here we have the 'chat_data.csv' file, which contains all the initial training data. Apart from the main training dataset, we will use the 'chat_logs.csv' file, which will be created automatically the first time we execute our main chat script.

## Usage
To train the bot run the code <br />
` python training.py`

then run the chatbot by executing the chat script <br />
` python chatbot.py `
